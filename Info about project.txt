Situation / Executive Question


Florida is exploring the variability of hosting the Summer Olympic games as a catalyst for infrastructure tourism, and economic development.

Central Question:

“Should the state of Florida host the Olympic games, if so where?”


Requirements:

Venues
40 Total Venues
Venue with Capacity of 80,000+ (Gainesville)
Infrastructure
Olympic Village
Broadcast Center
Public Transit Capacity
AIrports Should be able to Accommodate Influx of Passengers
Post-Use Plan for Infrastructure
Lodging and Hospitality
Must have 50,000 Rooms
Must have 5,000 Restaurants

Sponsorship
10 Corporate/Private Sector Sponsors
National and Local Government Backing


Joint-City Approach

Based on the requirements, no city in Florida currently has ALL of the things necessary to host the Olympic games. However, who said only one city had to host the games?

We are proposing a joint bid between Gainesville - Tampa - Orlando.

(Structured by Introduction → Analysis → Solution → Implementation → Financials → Conclusion)

I. Introduction
Objective
Set the scene for Florida’s bid to host the 2040–2050 Summer Olympics and define the strategic question: Can hosting the Games accelerate Florida’s infrastructure, economy, and global positioning while maintaining fiscal responsibility?
Required Content
Macro Overview of Florida


Use BEBR 2023 population estimates to describe Florida’s projected population growth (2025–2050).


Note that Florida is one of the fastest-growing U.S. states, adding roughly one mid-sized city’s worth of residents every year.


Summarize top growth counties by CAGR and absolute increase (Orange, Osceola, Lake, Polk, Sumter, Hillsborough, Marion).


Regional Strengths


Highlight the GTO Triangle (Gainesville–Tampa–Orlando) as an emerging economic super-region within FDOT District 5, supported by inter-city infrastructure and education hubs (UF, UCF, USF).


Brightline Expansion Context


Describe the Orlando–Tampa extension of Brightline’s inter-city rail as the transportation backbone enabling Games-time mobility and long-term connectivity.

Visual Insight
Florida’s demographic and tourism momentum, combined with its existing inter-city rail expansion, make the state uniquely positioned to host a cost-efficient, legacy-oriented Olympics.

II. Analysis
Objective
Establish evidence-based rationale for why GTO is the optimal cluster for hosting relative to alternatives.
Analytical Components
Population and Demand Analysis (BEBR)


Calculate population growth rate per county:

 CAGR = [(Pop_2050 / Pop_2025)^(1/25)] – 1


Aggregate to determine total Games-region population base.


Identify counties with the highest projected growth to justify venue locations and housing legacy needs.


Employment & Sectoral Structure (ACS + QCEW)


Use ACS Table S2403 (Industry by Sex) and QCEW data to determine sector composition across the host region.


Compute employment shares by sector:

 Sector_Share = Sector_Employment / Total_Employment
Identify dominant industries: construction, hospitality, education, healthcare, and services.


Commuting and Infrastructure Gaps (ACS + FDOT)


Extract ACS S0802 (Mean Travel Time) for inter-county commuters.


Quantify dependence on automobiles and the potential for mode shift to high-speed rail.


IOC Requirement Benchmarking


Compare Florida’s baseline infrastructure to IOC requirements: 40 venues, 80 000-seat stadium, 50 000 hotel rooms, 5 000 restaurants, and transit capacity for 300 000 rides/day.


Use existing Orlando/Tampa venue and lodging inventories to evaluate compliance.


Charts to Include
County Growth Ranking – bar chart ranking fastest-growing counties.


Sectoral Composition – stacked bar showing employment by industry across GTO.


Travel Time vs. Rail Potential – side-by-side bar chart comparing current vs. projected travel times.


IOC Compliance Matrix – color-coded table (Compliant / Upgrade / New Build).


Analytical Insight
The GTO corridor aligns with Florida’s fastest-growing and most economically diversified counties, satisfies 90 % of IOC infrastructure standards through existing assets, and demonstrates measurable congestion and productivity challenges that the Games can directly address.

III. Solution
Objective
Present the strategic plan—how hosting in the GTO corridor achieves the state’s goals.
Core Elements
Concept of Operations


Distribute Olympic functions across Gainesville (Core Stadium & Village), Orlando (Media & Tech Hub), and Tampa (Tourism & Hospitality Center).


Leverage existing FDOT District 5 corridors and the Brightline extension to integrate all three nodes.


Infrastructure Modernization Strategy


Accelerate the $66 billion FDOT investment program by prioritizing the GTO Inter-City Transit Corridor (rail + BRT).


Introduce digital/modular construction techniques to reduce build time and increase productivity by 50 %.


Housing Legacy Strategy


Convert the Olympic Village (Gainesville) into 3 000–4 000 permanent workforce and student housing units.


Formula:

 Housing_Need = (Pop_2050 – Pop_2025) / Average_Household_Size
 to show units required vs. planned supply.


Charts to Include
GTO System Map – showing three cities and infrastructure linkages.


Infrastructure Allocation – stacked bar of investment categories.
