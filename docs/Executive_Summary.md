Executive Summary — Florida GTO Olympic Proposal

Central Question
Does it make sense for the state of Florida to host the Summer Olympic Games? If so, will hosting increase tourism, boost local economies, and revitalize infrastructure?

Short answer
Yes — a joint-city bid anchored on the Gainesville–Tampa–Orlando (GTO) corridor is the most feasible, lower-risk approach for Florida to host a Summer Olympics. By distributing major functions across multiple cities (stadium & village, media & tech, tourism & hospitality) Florida leverages existing assets, minimizes single-city risk, and converts one-time Games investment into enduring infrastructure.

Key supporting points
- Demand & growth: BEBR county projections and our county heatmap show sustained, concentrated population growth in Orange, Polk, Hillsborough, and surrounding counties — providing workforce, housing demand, and local attendees.
- Venues: Existing facilities across Orlando and Tampa provide most of the venue count needed; Gainesville provides a uniquely valuable asset — Ben Hill Griffin Stadium (~88k) that meets the main-stadium requirement.
- Lodging & tourism: Orlando and Tampa together have hotel inventories large enough to satisfy core room requirements when combined with short-term upgrades and legacy conversions.
- Transportation & infrastructure: Brightline Orlando–Tampa extension and FDOT I-4 corridor upgrades create a backbone for inter-city mobility; additional BRT/corridor investments would be required to reach IOC transit targets.
- Legacy & housing: Olympic Village(s) can be converted to permanent workforce and student housing (3k–4k units), addressing local housing gaps and improving affordability.

Top benefits
1) Tourism uplift — Games produce a temporary surge in visitors and a durable brand boost for Florida as a global destination.
2) Local economic stimulus — construction, hospitality, and transport investments create job-years and recurring productivity gains via reduced travel times.
3) Infrastructure modernization — targeted spending on rail, BRT, and station-area development accelerates long-term regional connectivity.

Top risks & mitigations
- Cost overruns & schedule risk: use modular construction and phased delivery; assign state-level guarantees and private-sector P3s for high-cost items.
- Community acceptance & displacement: commit to explicit legacy conversions of Olympic Village to affordable/workforce housing; clear communications and community benefit agreements.
- IOC feasibility: joint-city bids require strong coordination; begin targeted dialogue early and demonstrate inter-city transport and venue clustering.

Recommendation
Proceed with a feasibility study and IOC-targeted dialogue for a GTO joint bid. Immediate next steps should include: (1) detailed venue inventory and gap analysis, (2) lodging capacity verification with Visit Florida data, (3) transit capacity modelling (Brightline + FDOT scenarios), and (4) a financing plan emphasizing P3s and legacy revenue (station-area development, tourism taxes, naming rights/sponsors).

Assumptions & data needs
- This summary is based on BEBR projections (Medium series), local venue inventories we collected, and the heatmap outputs in the `data/` folder. Detailed verification (hotel rooms, restaurant counts, transit ride capacity) will require Visit Florida, FDOT, and county-level datasets.

Next deliverables (proposed)
- A compliance matrix (CSV + visual) showing cities vs IOC requirements (created in `data/city_compliance_matrix.csv`).
- Slide deck outline and a first-pass slide deck (PPTX or PDF) with embedded heatmap and compliance visual.
- Short finance note showing approximate CAPEX split and payback sensitivities.
