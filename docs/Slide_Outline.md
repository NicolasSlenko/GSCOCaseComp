Slide deck outline — Florida GTO Olympic Proposal

Title slide
- Title: Florida Olympic Vision — Gainesville · Tampa · Orlando (GTO)
- Subtitle: Joint-city bid feasibility (2040–2050)
- Authors / Team / Date

1 — Executive summary
- One-line thesis: "Yes — Host via the GTO Triangle"
- 3 KPIs: Total infrastructure investment (est.), Annual productivity return (est.), Payback period (est.)
- Key recommendation and immediate next steps

2 — Situation & central question
- Problem statement & IOC requirements (40 venues, 80k stadium, Olympic Village, 50k rooms, 5k restaurants, transit capacity)
- Map: county heatmap (from `data/Florida_heatmap_2045.geojson`) showing growth intensity

3 — Why single-city bids fail
- Table: city-by-city compliance (use `data/city_compliance_matrix.csv`) — color-coded
- Short narrative: no single city meets ALL IOC criteria

4 — GTO solution overview
- Proposed distribution: Gainesville (main stadium & village), Orlando (media, tech, hospitality), Tampa (tourism, hotels, events), Lakeland (village conversion / logistics)
- System map showing Brightline + I-4 + major highways

5 — Venues & lodging validation
- Venue inventory summary (counts by city, capacities)
- Lodging: combined room counts and shortfall/surplus estimate
- Show stadiums (Ben Hill Griffin, Raymond James, Camping World) with capacities and proposed upgrades

6 — Transport & mobility (Transit ROI)
- Baseline transit and highway capacity (FDOT summary)
- Brightline Orlando–Tampa corridor as backbone
- Simple ROI model: time saved × labor force × VOT → annual productivity gain (formula + numbers)
- Recommendation: corridor upgrades + BRT + park-and-ride

7 — Economic impact & jobs
- CAPEX composition (Transit, Stadium/Village, Upgrades, Security)
- Job-years estimate from construction spending × multiplier
- Short-term vs long-term benefits

8 — Housing & legacy
- Village conversion plan: units, timeline, affordability impact
- Before/after rent-to-income ratio (conceptual)

9 — Governance & finance
- Delivery model: OCOG with state backing + P3s for venues and transit
- Funding sources: federal grants, state bonds, sponsor revenues, naming rights, tourism taxes

10 — Risks & mitigations
- Matrix: Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation (cost, schedule, community acceptance, IOC engagement)

11 — Implementation roadmap
- Phased timeline (Targeted dialogue → Engineering → Construction → Delivery)
- Milestones & decision gates for IOC bid

12 — Conclusion & ask
- One-sentence recommendation
- Ask: approval to proceed with targeted IOC dialogue and a detailed feasibility study

Appendix
- Methods: BEBR, ACS, FDOT assumptions; data sources
- Detailed tables: venue inventory, hotel counts, restaurant counts, transit capacity inputs

Speaker notes & visuals
- For each slide include a short speaker note (2–3 bullets) and one primary visual (map, bar, table). Use color palette defined in project notes.

Placeholders to fill after validation
- Visit Florida hotel inventory (exact rooms by county)
- FDOT transit capacity numbers (daily rides)
- Sponsorship pipeline (target list)
